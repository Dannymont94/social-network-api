## Description
Social media sites require databases that can handle large amounts of data. This project was made to showcase how MongoDB in conjunction with Mongoose is an excellent choice for these types of sites due to its flexibility when handling unstructured data. CRUD methods have been created for Users, Thoughts, and Reactions.
